# Publishes each paper that papers/papers.json marks "ready" or later to its companion repository, then
# locks that repository so only its owner can change it. .github/workflows/papers.yml runs this.
# It is the GENChase publisher (tools/paper-publish.sh there), with tools/paper_sync.py in place of
# tools/paper-sync.js, so the owner's papers all reach their companions and Zenodo the same way.
#
# GH_TOKEN   a fine-grained token with Contents and Administration read and write on the companion
#            repositories (docs/PUBLISHING-PAPERS.md). Without it nothing happens.
# PAPER      publish only this paper id (optional).
# RELEASE    also publish a release with this tag in PAPER's companion, the version written without a
#            leading v (1.0.0 and so on; owner's decision, 2026-09-26); Zenodo archives it and gives it a
#            DOI, if Zenodo is switched on for that repository. Its notes are the section "## <version>"
#            of papers/<id>/RELEASES.md, and a tag without one is refused before anything is published.
#            For a release that already exists, the run brings its notes up to date; the tag and its
#            files are never replaced. A release made before 2026-09-26 keeps its tag with the v:
#            RELEASE=v2.1.0 updates its notes from "## 2.1.0". A new tag with a leading v is refused, and
#            so is a plain tag whose version the companion already has under its v tag.
#            A tag with no published release must pass the new-release checks and match the reviewed
#            candidate tree. A draft release is refused before any repository content is changed.
#            New releases carry HendrickResearch_<paper-id>_<version>.zip. PAPER_ARCHIVE_MODE says how
#            Zenodo gets the release:
#              github-import  Zenodo's GitHub integration is switched on for the companion, so the
#                             GitHub release itself makes the Zenodo version (of GitHub's source ZIP).
#                             Needs ZENODO_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_ENABLED=true, the owner's confirmation.
#              manual-zenodo  As in GENChase: the import is off (ZENODO_GITHUB_INTEGRATION_DISABLED=true),
#                             and the owner uploads the exact branded asset into a new, unpublished
#                             version draft of the same DOI family.
#            This script never changes the Zenodo setting and never publishes to Zenodo itself.
#
# Direct edits are kept. The branch undeciphered-sync holds exactly what this repository published, one
# commit per change, and each run merges it into the companion's main branch, the record. Edits the owner
# makes there directly survive every run; if an edit and an update touch the same lines, the run stops,
# pushes nothing, and names the files. tools/paper-pull.sh brings direct edits back into papers/<id>/.
#
# The lock, renewed on every run, keeps everyone but the owner out: issues, wiki, projects and
# discussions off; GitHub's interaction limit at collaborators only for six months; rulesets that
# forbid deleting or force-pushing the default branch and deleting or moving tags. The owner can still
# commit to the default branch, on the web or with git. The lock also makes main the default branch, so a
# companion that held other work before its first publish shows, and Zenodo archives, only the paper.
